HW1_(i)_and_(iii)_1: 1.jpg ~ 10.jpg are the first part of the Basic Prime Testing and Fermat Primality Testing displaying pictures. To show the realation between input size(bits) n and running time, for all i.jpg, i starts from 1 to 30, means the test integer n is represented by 2^(i), or it has (i+1) bits.
HW1_(i)_and_(iii)_2: 11.jpg ~ 20.jpg are the second part of these.
HW1_(i)_and_(iii)_3: 21.jpg ~ 30.jpg are the third part of these.

HW2_(ii)_1: 1.jpg ~ 10.jpg are the first part of the Sieve of Eratosthenes displaying pictures. To show the realation between input size(bits) n and running time, for all i.jpg, i starts from 1 to 30, the program will find all primality elements in the range of (2, 2^(i)).
HW2_(ii)_2: 11.jpg ~ 20.jpg are the second part of these.
HW2_(ii)_3: 21.jpg ~ 30.jpg are the third part of these.
