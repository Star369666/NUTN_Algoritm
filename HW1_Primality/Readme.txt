HW1_(i)_and_(iii): 1.jpg ~ 10.jpg are the first part of the Basic Prime Testing and Fermat Primality Testing displaying pictures. To show the relation between input size(bits) n and running time, for all i.jpg, i starts from 1 to 30, means the test integer n is represented by 2^(i), or it has (i+1) bits.
11.jpg ~ 20.jpg are the second part of these.
21.jpg ~ 30.jpg are the third part of these.

HW2_(ii): 1.jpg ~ 10.jpg are the first part of the Sieve of Eratosthenes displaying pictures. To show the relation between input size(bits) n and running time, for all i.jpg, i starts from 1 to 27, the program will find all primality elements in the range of (2^(i-1), 2^(i)), where if i = 1, then it would be (2, 2).
11.jpg ~ 20.jpg are the second part of these.
21.jpg ~ 27.jpg are the third part of these.

HW3_(iii): The folder is the result of the Fermat Primality Testing displaying pictures, To show the ratio of correction between input size(digit) and ability to hit right answer, for all i.jpg, if i is odd, then it is a prime number test. Otherwise, a non-prime number test. "10_digit_with_1_to_25" is the last test that I tried to let my program mistake, but I eventually was failed. The correction is 100%.
